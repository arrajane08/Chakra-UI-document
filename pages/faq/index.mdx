## Is there a Datepicker in Chakra UI?

No, currently we don't provide a datepicker component. We recommend building
your own custom datepicker with Chakra UI and either `react-datepicker` or
`dayzed`.

## Tooltip does not work around disabled Button

In case you have wrapped a `Tooltip` around a disabled `Button` and you still
want to show the `Tooltip`, you need to provide the `shouldWrapChildren` prop to
the `Tooltip`.

Please be aware that this prop will break the `borderRadius` of the buttons
within a `ButtonGroup` because it wraps a span around the disabled buttons.

## How can I get Storybook to work with Chakra UI?

If you're facing an issue where Storybook isn't working with Chakra UI, here's a
work around ðŸ‘‡

In your `.storybook/main.js` file, you'll need to config the `features` and
`webpackFinal` properties like so:

```jsx live=false
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../**/*.stories.mdx', '../**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  framework: '@storybook/react',
  // unpins Storybook's dependence on Emotion 10 so that build can compile successfully
  features: { emotionAlias: false },
  webpackFinal: async (config, { configType }) => {
    // `configType` has a value of 'DEVELOPMENT' or 'PRODUCTION'
    // You can change the configuration based on that.
    // 'PRODUCTION' is used when building the static version of storybook.

    // https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension/issues/621#issuecomment-759341776
    // framer-motion uses the .mjs notation and we need to include it so that webpack will
    // transpile it for us correctly (enables using a CJS module inside an ESM).
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\.mjs$/,
      include: /node_modules/,
      type: 'javascript/auto',
    })
    // Return the altered config
    return config
  },
}
```
