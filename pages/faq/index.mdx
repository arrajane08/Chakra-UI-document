## Is there a Datepicker in Chakra UI?

No, currently we don't provide a datepicker component. We recommend building your
own custom datepicker with Chakra UI and either `react-datepicker` or `dayzed`.

## Tooltip does not work around disabled Button

In case you have wrapped a `Tooltip` around a disabled `Button` and you still 
want to show the `Tooltip`, you need to provide the `shouldWrapChildren` prop to 
the `Tooltip`.

Please be aware that this prop will break the `borderRadius` of the buttons 
within a `ButtonGroup` because it wraps a span around the disabled buttons.
