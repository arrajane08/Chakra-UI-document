Chakra UI v2 is focused on providing compatibility for React 18. Doing so we had
to introduce some breaking changes. That lead us to remove some features that we
deprecated previously.

---

## Upgrade steps

Here is a list of steps to migrate your project to v2.

### 1. Update your dependencies

Make sure you update all `@chakra-ui` packages you use to
`@chakra-ui/<package-name>@2.0.0` and your `react` dependencies to at least v18

> ðŸš¨ Chakra UI v2 is not backwards compatible with React v17 and lower. Make
> sure to upgrade to React v18.

Here is how your dependencies could look like:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@chakra-ui/react": "^2.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  }
}
```

Step 2 and 3 are only necessary if you used the mentioned functions in your
project.

### 2. Update createStandaloneToast

We had to make some changes to the our `createStandaloneToast` function, because
of changes in the way React 18 works.

Chakra UI v1 rendered the toast container DOM element for you. The usage of
`createStandaloneToast` could look like this:

```ts
import { createStandaloneToast } from '@chakra-ui/toast'

const toast = createStandaloneToast()
toast({ title: 'Chakra UI' })
```

In v2 you need to render the `ToastContainer` in your application code. This
allows you have only one React root in your application.

Here is an example on how to update your code:

```tsx
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { createStandaloneToast } from '@chakra-ui/toast'

const { ToastContainer, toast } = createStandaloneToast()

// render the ToastContainer in your React root
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.createRoot(yourRootElement).render(
  <>
    <App />
    <ToastContainer />
  </>,
)

toast({ title: 'Chakra UI' })
```

> Please note: There are **no breaking changes** to the hook `useToast`. There
> are only breaking changes to `createStandaloneToast`.

### 3. Deprecated features

We removed some previously deprecated features from Chakra UI v2. Here is a
detailed list of affected components or packages:

#### Button, Icon Button, Input, NumberInput, Radio, Checkbox, Select

We removed the `isFullWidth` prop from these components. Use `width="full"` or
`width="100%"` instead.

#### Checkbox

We removed the `defaultIsChecked` prop from the `Checkbox` component. Use the
`defaultChecked` prop instead.

#### Color mode

We removed the references to `--chakra-ui-color-mode`. Use the `data-theme`
property instead

#### Hooks

We removed the `useEventCallback` hook

#### Grid

We removed the `area` prop from the `Grid` component. You can pass it to the
`GridItem` component instead.

#### Styled system

We removed the `d` style prop. Use written out `display` prop instead.

We removed the `isTruncated` style prop. You can use `noOfLines={1}` instead.

#### Theme

We removed deprecated types.
