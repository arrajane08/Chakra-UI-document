If you'd like to extend your [Formik](https://formik.org/) integration, you can
definetly do that with ChakraUI. In the following example we'll create a custom
`ImageRadio` component.

To get the necessary props from ChakraUI for the Radio button, we'll use
`useRadio` and on top of that we'll define constant to see if the `Radio` is
checked.

To hook up our custom `Radio` component with Formik, we'll use `useField`.

Last but not least, we'll need to render our content, we'll pass the
`getInputProps` and `getCheckedProps` from Chakra to complete the integration.

import {
  App as AppValidation,
  Index as IndexValidation,
  ImageRadio as ImageRadioValidation,
  RadioGroup as RadioGroupValidation,
  Input as InputValidation,
} from 'configs/sandpack-contents/advanced-formik-integration/image-radio-buttons'

<SandpackEmbed
  options={{
    editorHeight: 600,
    editorWidthPercentage: 60,
  }}
  zIndex={0}
  tabIndex={-1}
  dependencies={{
    formik: '2.2.9',
  }}
  files={{
    '/App.tsx': AppValidation,
    '/index.tsx': IndexValidation,
    '/image-radio.tsx': ImageRadioValidation,
    '/radio-group.tsx': RadioGroupValidation,
    '/input.tsx': InputValidation,
  }}
/>

As you can see in this example we're using a `Radio Group` to render multiple
radio buttons and on top of that we've also created an `Input`.

The goal is when we submit the form, we should get the value of the input and
which **radio** we've picked.

So to go ahead and try it, submit the form and check the console in the
CodeSandbox.
