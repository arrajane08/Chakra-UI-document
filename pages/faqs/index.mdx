## Is there a Datepicker in Chakra UI?

No, currently we don't provide a datepicker component. We recommend building your
own custom datepicker with Chakra UI and either `react-datepicker` or `dayzed`.

## Tooltip does not work around disabled Button

In case you have wrapped a `Tooltip` around a disabled `Button` and you want that 
the `Tooltip` still shows up you need to provide it the `shouldWrapChildren` prop.

Please be aware that this prop will break the `borderRadius` of the `Buttons` 
within a `ButtonGroup` because it wraps a span around the disabled `Button`.
