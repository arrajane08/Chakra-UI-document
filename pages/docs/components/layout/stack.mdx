Stack is a layout component that makes it easy to stack elements together and
apply a space between them. It uses a modified version of the
[CSS lobotomized owl selector](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/)
to add spacing between its children.

## Import

```js
import { Stack, HStack, VStack } from '@chakra-ui/react'
```

## VStack

The `VStack` component is a component which is **only** facing the vertical
direction. Additionally you can add a divider and vertical spacing between the
items.

## HStack

The `HStack` component is a component which is **only** facing the horizontal
direction. Additionally you can add a divider and horizontal spacing between the
items.

## Usage

To stack elements in horizontal or vertical direction only, use the `HStack` or
`VStack` components. You can also use the `Stack` component as well and pass the
`direction` prop.

```jsx
<HStack spacing='24px'>
  <Box w='40px' h='40px' bg='yellow.200'>
    1
  </Box>
  <Box w='40px' h='40px' bg='tomato'>
    2
  </Box>
  <Box w='40px' h='40px' bg='pink.100'>
    3
  </Box>
</HStack>
```

### Responsive direction

You can pass responsive values to the `Stack` component to change stack
direction and/or spacing between elements.

```jsx
<Stack direction={['column', 'row']} spacing='24px'>
  <Box w='40px' h='40px' bg='yellow.200'>
    1
  </Box>
  <Box w='40px' h='40px' bg='tomato'>
    2
  </Box>
  <Box w='40px' h='40px' bg='pink.100'>
    3
  </Box>
</Stack>
```

### Stack Dividers

In some scenarios, you may want to add dividers between stacked elements. Pass
the `divider` prop and set its value to the `StackDivider` or any custom React
element.

```jsx
<VStack
  divider={<StackDivider borderColor='gray.200' />}
  spacing={4}
  align='stretch'
>
  <Box h='40px' bg='yellow.200'>
    1
  </Box>
  <Box h='40px' bg='tomato'>
    2
  </Box>
  <Box h='40px' bg='pink.100'>
    3
  </Box>
</VStack>
```

### Stack items horizontally

Pass the `direction` and set it to `row`. Optionally, you can use `align` and
`justify` to adjust the alignment and distribution of the items.

#### Feature Cards with Stack Component

```jsx manual=true
function Feature({ title, desc, ...rest }) {
  return (
    <Box p={5} shadow='md' borderWidth='1px' {...rest}>
      <Heading fontSize='xl'>{title}</Heading>
      <Text mt={4}>{desc}</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

function StackEx() {
  return (
    <Stack spacing={8} direction='row'>
      <Feature
        title='Plan Money'
        desc='The future can be even brighter but a goal without a plan is just a wish'
      />
      <Feature
        title='Save Money'
        desc='You deserve good things. With a whooping 10-15% interest rate per annum, grow your savings on your own terms with our completely automated process'
      />
    </Stack>
  )
}

render(<StackEx />)
```

#### Feature Cards with HStack Component

In the example following, we can notice that for the `HStack` component, we
don't need the direction props, since this component is specifically for
horizontally stacking items.

```jsx manual=true
function Feature({ title, desc, ...rest }) {
  return (
    <Box p={5} shadow='md' borderWidth='1px' {...rest}>
      <Heading fontSize='xl'>{title}</Heading>
      <Text mt={4}>{desc}</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

function StackEx() {
  return (
    <HStack spacing={8}>
      <Feature
        title='Plan Money'
        desc='The future can be even brighter but a goal without a plan is just a wish'
      />
      <Feature
        title='Save Money'
        desc='You deserve good things. With a whooping 10-15% interest rate per annum, grow your savings on your own terms with our completely automated process'
      />
    </HStack>
  )
}

render(<StackEx />)
```

### Notes on Stack vs Flex

The `Stack` component and the `Flex` component have their children spaced out
evenly but the **key** difference is that the `Stack` won't span the entire
width of the container whereas the `Flex` will.

## Props

<PropsTable of='Stack' />
