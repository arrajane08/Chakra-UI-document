description:
  Containers are the most basic layout element in Chakra. It is used to
  constrain the maximum of the content it wraps.
---

Containers are used to constrain a content's width to the current breakpoint,
while keeping it fluid.

By default, it sets the `max-width` of the content to 60 characters (`60ch`) but
you can customize this by passing custom `maxWidth` values or changing the
container size tokens defined in `theme.sizes.container`.

## Import

```js
import { Container } from '@chakra-ui/react'
```

## Usage

To contain any piece of content, wrap it in the `Container` component.

```jsx
<Container>
  There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
  does it bring benefits to the design team, but it also brings benefits to
  engineering teams. It makes sure that our experiences have a consistent look
  and feel, not just in our design specs, but in production
</Container>
```

## Container Size

To set the size of a Container, use the `maxW` attribute.

```jsx
<VStack>
  <Container maxW='container.xl'>Extra-Large Container</Container>
  <Container maxW='container.lg'>Large Container</Container>
  <Container maxW='container.md'>Medium Container</Container>
  <Container maxW='container.sm'>Small Container</Container>
</VStack>
```

## Centering the children

In some cases, the width of the content can be smaller than the container's
width. You can use the `centerContent` prop to center the content. It renders a
flexbox with `flexDirection` set to `column` and `alignItems` set to `center`.

```jsx
<Container maxW='2xl' bg='blue.600' centerContent>
  <Box padding='4' bg='blue.400' color='black' maxW='md'>
    There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
    does it bring benefits to the design team, but it also brings benefits to
    engineering teams. It makes sure that our experiences have a consistent look
    and feel, not just in our design specs, but in production.
  </Box>
</Container>
```

## Props

Container composes `Box` so you can pass all `Box` related props in addition to
this.

<PropsTable of='Container' />
